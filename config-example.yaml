# This is a docker CLI-compatible list of volumes to automatically
# mount to all launched containers.
#
# If you are using a remote docker host, these paths should be
# based on the host machine, not your client machine. As well,
# the destination path is what you should use in volumeMap for
# determining the mapping from cwd to the container.
volumes:
  - /media/host:/media/host

# volumeMap represents a map between your local machine and
# the location inside of the container.
#
# This is used when you are connecting to a remote host and
# need to do a conversion map. If dockhere cannot find an
# entry in this map for your cwd, it will NOT change the
# workdir in the launched container.
volumeMap:
  "/Users/myuser/src": /media/host/src
